# MarvelApp
A simple Android app that provides easy access to a list of available comics hosted by Marvel and detailed information about each one of them.

## What I would do different or I would add if I had more time
* I would add a `SplashScreen` and would move the comics call to it
* I would create a local `database` to save the comics
* I would create a class `MarvelLocalData` to get the information from the database
* I would modify the class `MarvelRepository` to receive the `MarvelLocalData` in the constructor and then return the local saved comics in case there was no internet
* I would move the `SearchView` to the `Toolbar`
* I would implement the `search to filter` the comics once given a budget
* I would implement `more tests`
* I would modify the details screen to use `parallax effect`
* I would turn the images comic `images circled`
* I would add more information on `details screen` such as stories, events, characters
* I would allow the user find `more information about the authors` such as other comics they have created, series, event, stories
* I would implement parcelable or use `AutoValue` and related on models and remove the `Serializable` implementation
* I would `polish the layouts`
